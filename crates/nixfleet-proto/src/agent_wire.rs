//! Agent ↔ control-plane wire types (RFC-0003 §4).
//!
//! Defined in this crate (rather than in either binary) so the agent
//! and CP serialise/deserialise from one schema and the Nix harness
//! can reuse the same types for assertions. The checkin body adds
//! `pendingGeneration`, `lastEvaluatedTarget`, `lastFetchOutcome`,
//! and `uptimeSecs` on top of RFC-0003 §4.1's minimum — all nullable,
//! additive over the wire.
//!
//! Unknown-field posture follows the crate-level convention: serde's
//! default is to ignore unknowns; consumers MUST treat additions
//! within the same major version as backwards-compatible.
